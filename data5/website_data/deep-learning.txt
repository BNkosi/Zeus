H2: Why Deep Learning?
H3: Make better decisions and smart actions in real time without human intervention
Paragraph: Four megatrends are fundamentally changing the shape of our world:
Vast amounts of data are being generated every minute.
The processing speed of our machines is increasing exponentially.
We now have cloud providers who can store insane amounts of data for a few dollars.
Powerful open source algorithms that can read, write, translate and see are now available to everyone.
Paragraph: All of these things above mean that it�s becoming easier and quicker to produce models that can analyze bigger/more complex data and deliver more accurate results � even on a very large scale. By building deep learning models a business might have a better chance of identifying profitable opportunities � or avoiding unknown risks.

H2: Why Data Science?
H3: Join the fastest-growing corner of the tech industry
Paragraph: More than ever before, industries are capturing data on a variety of topics, behaviours and trends. Without data science, this information stays stuck - no story to tell and no insights to share. In order to determine business goals, more and more companies are looking to data scientists to fill in the gaps and find opportunities never before considered or understood.
Paragraph: Over the last 4 years, the rise of job opportunities for data scientists has become almost level to those traditionally seen for software engineering positions.
Paragraph: As this area expertise has grown, the positions within the field become more nuanced. After completing our NYC Data Science Bootcamp, students will not only be able to secure a job as a data scientist, but can also consider pursuing any of the following related positions.
Data Engineer

 EXPLORE Overview
EXPLORE is a next generation Learning Institution that teaches students the skills of 
the future. From Data Science to Data Engineering to Machine Learning to Deep 
Learning we deliver cutting edge courses to satisfy your hunger to learn. Our 
Programmes are built by an amazing Faculty - we learn employ some of the world’s 
most talented Scientists who have experience solving diﬃcult problems on a global 
stage.
Our philosophy is to teach our students how to solve problems in the real world. 
We emphasise teamwork, collaboration and working within constraints, under 
pressure, with deadlines while understanding context, audience and 
implementation challenges. We are not a theoretical institution (although we cover 
the theory) - we are a ‘practical, hands-on, roll-up-your-sleeves and get stuﬀ done’ 
kind of institution. As real-world Scientists who have delivered impact in the world of 
work we’re well positioned to deliver these skills.
EXPLORE launched during 2013 and since then has taught 1,000’s of students and 
solved many problems for businesses across multiple Industries across the world. 
We’re reinventing education and invite you to join us to change things for the 
better.

 Why Machine Learning?
Four megatrends are fundamentally changing the shape of our world: 
Unlimited Data Incredible Speed
Vast amounts of data  The processing speed of our

Cloud Integration Open Source Algorithms
We now have cloud providers who  Powerful open source algorithms 
can store insane amounts of data  that can read, write, translate and

It is critical that the entire organisation understands the power of data and understand how it can 
be gathered, analysed and used for business value. Every employee - from CEO to bank teller - 
needs to appreciate the importance of data so that the organisation can transform to being 
data-driven and Insights-led.

This course is geared towards experienced practitioners in the ﬁeld of data science who want to 
enhance their analytical skills and knowledge. It will be beneﬁcial to Data Science professionals who 
want to upskill themselves with the latest machine learning techniques..
This course is very technical in nature. It is therefore recommended that you have a deep 
understanding of mathematics and statistics. Above average skills in at least one programming 
language is recommended as well as a few years experience working in the ﬁeld of Data Science..
How You'll Learn
Every course is broken down into manageable, weekly units, designed to accelerate your learning 
process through diverse learning activities: 
Work through downloadable content and online instructional material
Interact with your peers and learning facilitators through real-time chat 
platforms and regular live webinars.
Enjoy a wide range of interactive content, including video lectures, coding 
challenges, hackathons, and presentations.
Investigate real-world case studies.
Learn how to use Jupyter Notebook, GitHub, Power BI, AWS, and various 
machine learning models.
Apply what you learn each week to quizzes, coding challenges and ongoing 
project submissions, culminating in the ability to use real-world data to solve a 
real-life problem.

 EXPLORE Philosophy: Solving problems in the real world
At EXPLORE we focus on building our student’s ability to solve problems in the real world. Building 
things that work and make a diﬀerence is hard - that’s what we teach.
We’re not a traditional learning institution that spends weeks teaching matrix multiplication on a 
whiteboard (although understanding that is useful) - we’re a practical, solution-oriented institution 
that teaches our students to work in teams, under pressure, with deadlines while understanding 
context, constraints and the audience.
Our courses are typically broken into Sprints where we teach a core set of concepts within the 
framework of solving a problem in a team with a tight deadline.
1 2 3
Students cycle from Sprint to Sprint solving diﬀerent problems in diﬀerent teams as they build this 
core muscle over the course.

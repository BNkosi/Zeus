    <h1>Scoring at EXPLORE - an explanation</h1>
    <div class=3D"Section1">
        <p>Dear EXPLORERs,</p>
<p>&nbsp;A number of you have had questions about your marks for each sprin=
t and what they mean. This communication is meant to address those question=
s (and hopefully answer one or two you didn=E2=80=99t know you had).</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>How do I get marks and what do they mean?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>At EXPLORE the Data Science qualification is aligned with SETA, meaning =
that when you have successfully finished with the course, you will have an =
NQF 5 accredited qualification. Since the course is SETA accredited, you do=
n=E2=80=99t "pass" or "fail". You are found either "competent" or "not yet =
competent" in a given area, or =E2=80=9Cunit standard=E2=80=9D. The trains,=
 tests and predicts are built to align with these unit standards.</p>
<p>In each Sprint, there are a set number of belt points available. These p=
oints are divided among Trains, Tests and Predicts and align with the vario=
us unit standards. Your overall sprint score is an indication of the propor=
tion of available belt points you have gained for that sprint (i.e. a score=
 of 70% means that you have gained 70% of the points for that Sprint).</p>
<p>As you go through the course and complete the material, you accumulate p=
oints in unit standards. You need to accumulate enough points to be deemed =
"competent". An overall "competent" mark equates to about <strong>70% (or a=
pproximately 460)</strong> of the belt points available in the fundamentals=
 phase. However, this is the bare minimum and we expect the majority of our=
 students will perform much better than this.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>So if I don=E2=80=99t get 70% for the fundamentals phase, does that =
mean I fail the course? Will I be kicked out if I do badly in any sprint?</=
p></li>
</ul>
<p>Not at all! Belt points are cumulative, so if you do not have enough bel=
t points at the end of fundamentals, you will have plenty of opportunity to=
 accumulate more through the machine learning phase (the second six months)=
 to make up the shortfall.</p>
<p>Therefore, you cannot "fail" a sprint and you will not be kicked out of =
the course. In the unlikely event that you do not accumulate the required p=
oints throughout the entire course, you will not get an accredited qualific=
ation, but will still get a certificate of completion stating the tools and=
 techniques that you have experience with.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Does that mean that any belt points above the required amount are me=
aningless?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>No. Your accumulated belt points are also used to calculate your belt le=
vel, which is indicative of your mastery of the content. The scales are as =
follows:</p>
<p>Belt colour&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Score =
(total accumulated belt points)</p>
<p>White: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=
;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &lt;15%</p>
<p>Yellow: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=
p;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;15%</p>
<p>Orange: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbs=
p;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;30%</p>
<p>Green: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=
;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;40%</p>
<p>Blue: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;=
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;50%</p>
<p>Brown: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=
;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;65%</p>
<p>Red: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&=
nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;80%</p>
<p>Black: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp=
;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &gt;90%</p>
<p>Your belt level will also be displayed on your certificate, so it=E2=80=
=99s in your best interest to do as well as you can, especially if you want=
 to wow future employers.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>So then how do I track my progress?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Your current belt level and belt score (accumulated total of belt points=
 so far) can be found under your profile in Athena. This is the best indica=
tor of your progress. The EGAD diagram shows the proportion of the <strong>=
total</strong> available belt points that you have earned for each EXPLORE =
basic pillar of Data Science (Explain, Gather, Analyse, Deploy). This is pu=
rely for your own enlightenment, to give you an idea of where your own stre=
ngths lie, but otherwise has no bearing on your marks.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Great! Can you tell me how many points each thing is worth so I know=
 what to focus on?</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We=E2=80=99re reluctant to share exact point allocations and weightings =
for each piece of content. This is because we want to discourage =E2=80=9Cp=
oint chasing=E2=80=9D and gaming of the system. Many an EXPLORER has found =
themselves in a difficult place because they spent too much time maximizing=
 belt points and too little time understanding the material.</p>
<p>However, a VERY rough breakdown is as follows: 33% of points go to Train=
s, 33% to tests and 33% to the Predict. This will change slightly depending=
 on the sprint and its requirements but holds more or less true throughout.=
</p>
<p></p>
<ul>
<li><p>Help! My points went up/down/disappeared/blew up/took my dog and lef=
t in the night!</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Athena is a complex beast with lots of calculations going on in the back=
ground. Occasionally we may also have to slightly change belt point allocat=
ions due to errors with tests or submission or other administrative gremlin=
s. As such, your belt point totals may vary slightly from time to time. If =
you notice a big change or feel that something is wrong, you are welcome to=
 reach out to us at <a href=3D"mailto:online@explore-ai.net" class=3D"exter=
nal-link" rel=3D"nofollow">online@explore-ai.net</a> and we will do what we=
 can to help.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Thanks for the info, but you didn=E2=80=99t address (insert importan=
t thing here).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>We=E2=80=99re sure we=E2=80=99ve forgotten something, so if you have any=
 burning questions around this, feel free to reach out to us at <a href=3D"=
mailto:online@explore-ai.net" class=3D"external-link" rel=3D"nofollow">onli=
ne@explore-ai.net</a> and we will do our best to give you an accurate and h=
onest answer.</p>

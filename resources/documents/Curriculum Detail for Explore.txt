Start thinking like a machine learning engineer
The course will start by covering the basics of programming in python - building
functions to automate analysis. After the foundations have been set, participants
will master the model building process and the various machine learning
algorithms to use when predicting or classifying personal loans as well as
exploring techniques such as clustering and natural language processing. In the
final phase participants will dive deeper into the more complex machine learning
techniques - deep learning, where they will cover all the various neural networks.

Machine Learning
Participants will cover the whole model building process using python’s Sci-kit
Learn library. They will start by pre-processing the data to be ready for modeling
and then go through the machine learning algorithms for classifying whether
someone will take out a loan or not. Then it will be all about regression algorithms
to predict the amount of the loan for those who took out a loan. Secondly, they
5
will look at unsupervised learning algorithms which will be combined with
Natural Language processing techniques. Finally, participants will cover three

We take teaching seriously. Great teachers inspire us to connect with topics on a
profound level. With experience in the field and the classroom, our data science
instructors are unmatched. Simply put: students learn from the best.
------------------------------------------------------------------------Why Machine Learning?
Make better decisions and smart actions in real time without
human intervention.
The amount of data being produced is increasing exponentially due to the
Internet of Things. Data storage is becoming cheaper and processing power is
becoming greater.
6
All of these things above mean that it’s becoming easier and quicker to produce
models that can analyze bigger/more complex data and deliver more accurate
results – even on a very large scale. By building prediction models a business has
a better chance of identifying profitable opportunities – or avoiding unknown
risks.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FAQ
What software tools will we cover in the course?
You will code using Python in a Jupyter Notebook environment.
What are some of the problems will we solve in the course?
You will solve problems such as predicting whether someone will take out a
personal loan and what the amount will be, selecting the most optimal football
team given player attributes, predicting whether someone will take out a claim or
not (as well as the amount) and grouping reviews (text) data into the most
appropriate clusters to find out what customers are complaining about.
Will it be technical?
Yes. Even though there is complex maths behind some of the models, we won’t
explicitly cover it. We will mainly cover how the algorithms work and how to
implement them in Python. As additional material, a textbook with the
algorithms will be provided.
Are there any prerequisites for the course?
No. If you are sponsored however, you will have to do an online test, bootcamp
and speed interview.
How will I be graded?
7
At EXPLORE we have what is called the Belt system. You will receive points for
completing tutorials, test results, project results and peer assessment. These
points will build up and can be mapped to a certain belt level which ranger from
white to black.
Which algorithms will we cover in the course?
Supervised Learning - linear regression, logistic regression, decision trees, random
forests, SVM’s, k-nearest neighbours.
Unsupervised learning - variance thresholds, PCA, k-means clustering,
hierarchical clustering, Gaussian mixture models.
Deep learning - ANN’s, CNN’s, RNN’s
What is the difference between classification and regression?
Classification refers to when we are trying to predict which category a certain
observation will fall into, while regression refers to when we are trying to predict a
numeric value

----------------------------------------------------------------------------Why Data Analytics?
Join the fastest-growing corner of the tech industry
More than ever before, industries are capturing data on a variety of topics,
behaviours and trends. Without data analytics, this information stays stuck - no
story to tell and no insights to share. In order to determine business goals, more
13
and more companies are looking to data analysts to fill in the gaps and find
opportunities never before considered or understood.
Over the last 4 years, the rise of job opportunities for data analysts has become
almost level to those traditionally seen for software engineering positions.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FAQ
What software tools will we cover in the course?
You will use the following tools in the course:
● Excel - mainly used for analysing data

What is the difference between a data analyst and a data scientist?
A data analyst focus is on statistically analysing, visualising and communicating
data, and only using basic programming for data analysis. A data scientist uses
more machine learning algorithms to solve problems and uses complex
programming for more than just data analyses (e.g. data engineering).
What are some of the problems will we solve in the course?
You will solve fun problems like picking the best football team based on player
stats as well as more practical problems like predicting which policyholder will
make a medical insurance claim in the next year.

explicitly cover it. However, the material will be available for those who are
interested in the details.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------Why Visualise?
Turn complex problems into simple visuals.
Complex technologies and programming languages involved in data
science make it hard for non-technical people to understand it. That’s
when data visualization comes into play and allows those less technical to
grasp what is being said.
Dashboards enable us to create this visual story. Power BI has been one of
the leaders in the industry when it comes to dashboarding software.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------FAQ
What software tools will we cover in the course?
You will use Power BI for the duration of the course..
What are some of the problems will we solve in the course?
You will build a dashboard tell a story of the RCB IPL cricket team’s performance
(as a team and individuals).
Are there any prerequisites for the course?
No. Only a hunger to learn more about visualisation and dashboard building.
Will I be graded?
No, however in order to complete the course you will have to submit a few
multiple choice quizzes and a dashboard - these will be done in the 2 days at the
bootcamp.
